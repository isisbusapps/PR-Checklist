# PR-Checklist
Auto-comment on all new Pull Requests with a checklist that must be completed before merge.

## Note
This is still in easy stages of development and may change/break.

## Example

## Requirements

All comments are added by [@PR-Checklist](https://github.com/PR-Checklist) so you will need to grant read access to this user on any of your private repositories you wish to associate. 

Currently a manual process is required to accept organisation invites. No pull request comments will be made until after this process.
